# To use sqlite3 for development or testing, change the "postgres" reference to

#development:

#  database: "db/contradev.sqlite3"

development:
  <<: *postgres
  database: contradev

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
