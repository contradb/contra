# To use sqlite3 for development or testing, change the "postgres" reference to
# "sqlite" and set the database field to a path to the database file.  E.g.:
#
#development:
#  <<: *sqlite
#  database: "db/contradev.sqlite3"

development:
  <<: *postgres
  database: contradev

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
